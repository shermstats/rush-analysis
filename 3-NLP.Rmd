Now that we've analyzed Rush's musical development, what about lyrics?
One thing that should make this a straightforward task is that Neil
Peart has been Rush's sole lyricist since 1975.  For this reason I'll
be excluding Rush's debut, along with Best I Can and In the End from
Fly By Night, as Neil Peart did not write any of the lyrics.
